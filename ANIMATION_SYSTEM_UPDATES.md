# Animation System Updates

## Overview
Updated the animation system to support animation sets for abilities, automatic loading of all animations on character spawn, and random animation selection for ability casting.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `animation-assets.ts`
- **Reorganized animations** into proper categories (Melee, Combat, Magic, Emote)
- **Added Animation Sets** - grouped animations by purpose:
  - `MeleeAnimationSet` - Contains all melee attacks (punches, kicks)
  - `IceRainAnimationSet` - Ice Rain ability animations
  - `EarthquakeAnimationSet` - Earthquake ability animations  
  - `SoulDrainAnimationSet` - Soul Drain ability animations
  - `CombatAnimationSet` - Combat reactions (damage, dodge)
  - `EmoteAnimationSet` - Emote animations (taunt)
- **Added helper functions**:
  - `getAllAnimationIds()` - Gets all animation IDs for preloading
  - `getAnimationId(key)` - Gets animation ID by key
- **Created AnimationIdMap** for efficient key-to-ID lookups
- **Fixed type exports** for better TypeScript support

### 2. Enhanced `animation-helpers.ts`
- **Added `LoadAllCharacterAnimations()`** - Loads all available animations on character spawn
- **Added `PlayRandomAnimationFromSet()`** - Plays random animation from a set
- **Fixed missing `getAnimationId()` reference**
- **Updated imports** to use new animation asset structure
- **Improved error handling** and validation

### 3. Updated `ability-catalog.ts`
- **Added animation sets** to each ability definition
- **Modified `runCastSuccessEffects()`** to accept animation sets
- **Updated OnStartSuccess callbacks** to use random animations from sets
- **Each ability now has its own animation variety**:
  - Melee: Randomly selects from punches and kicks
  - Ice-Rain: Casting animations appropriate for ice magic
  - Earthquake: Ground-based casting animations
  - Soul-Drain: Summoning-style animations

### 4. Extended `ability-meta.ts`
- **Added `animationSet` property** - Optional array of animation IDs for each ability
- **Maintains backward compatibility** - Property is optional

### 5. Improved `animation-service.ts`
- **Simplified character handling** - Now loads ALL animations automatically
- **Updated to use `LoadAllCharacterAnimations()`** instead of selective loading
- **Removed dependency** on old animation catalog functions
- **Cleaner import structure**

### 6. Restructured `animation-catalog.ts`
- **Replaced old implementation** with new animation set references
- **Added helper functions** for getting animations by category
- **Maintained compatibility** with existing code

## How It Works Now

### Character Spawn
1. When a character spawns, `LoadAllCharacterAnimations()` is called
2. This loads ALL emotes, ability animations, and combat animations
3. Character is ready to use any animation immediately

### Ability Casting
1. Player activates an ability (e.g., Melee)
2. `OnStartSuccess` callback is triggered
3. `PlayRandomAnimationFromSet()` is called with the ability's animation set
4. A random animation is selected from the set (e.g., punch or kick)
5. The selected animation plays on the character

### Animation Sets
Each ability now has variety:
- **Melee**: Will randomly punch, kick, or perform other melee attacks
- **Ice-Rain**: Will use appropriate casting animations for ice magic
- **Earthquake**: Will use ground-targeting spell animations
- **Soul-Drain**: Will use summoning/channeling animations

## Benefits

1. **Variety**: Each ability cast looks different with random animations
2. **Performance**: All animations loaded once on spawn, no loading delays
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new animations to existing abilities
4. **Flexibility**: Animation sets can be modified without code changes
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper types
6. **Modularity**: Clear separation between animation data and logic

## TODO Items Addressed
- ✅ Fixed missing `getAnimationID()` function
- ✅ Organized animation loading system
- ✅ Added animation variety to abilities
- ❌ Still need to replace placeholder animation IDs with real ones

## Next Steps
1. Replace placeholder animation IDs (`rbxassetid://0`) with actual asset IDs
2. Add more animation variations to existing sets
3. Create animation sets for future abilities
4. Test animation variety in-game
