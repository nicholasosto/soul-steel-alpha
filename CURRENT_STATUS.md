- **❌ Player Stats**: Health, mana, level systems not yet implemented

#### 2. Animation System
- **✅ Animation Service**: Service structure and helper functions
- **✅ Asset Integration**: Animation IDs and playback utilities
- **🚧 Character Integration**: Basic animation support, needs expansion

#### 3. Network Communication
- **✅ Remote Definitions**: Comprehensive remote event/function definitions
- **✅ Message Broadcasting**: Server-to-client message system working
- **🚧 Ability Activation**: Network calls defined but not fully implemented
- **❌ Security Validation**: Server-side validation needs implementation

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

#### 1. Gameplay Mechanics
- **❌ Combat System**: Damage calculation, health management
- **❌ Resource Management**: Mana/stamina systems
- **❌ Targeting System**: Target selection for abilities
- **❌ Cooldown Tracking**: Ability usage limitations
- **❌ Area of Effect**: Radius-based ability interactions

#### 2. Player Progression
- **❌ Character Levels**: Experience and leveling system
- **❌ Ability Unlocks**: Progressive ability access
- **❌ Equipment System**: Gear and item management

#### 3. Visual Effects
- **❌ Particle Systems**: Visual effects for abilities
- **❌ Environmental Effects**: Destruction, impact visuals
- **❌ UI Animations**: Smooth transitions and feedback

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Modular server services
2. **Atomic Design**: UI component organization
3. **Reactive Programming**: Fusion-based state management
4. **Type-Safe Keys**: String literal types for identifiers
5. **Metadata-Driven**: Configuration-based ability definitions

### Key Technologies
- **roblox-ts ^3.0.0**: TypeScript to Lua compilation
- **@rbxts/net**: Type-safe networking
- **@rbxts/fusion**: Reactive UI framework
- **@rbxts/types ^1.0.800**: Roblox API types

### Code Quality Features
- **Strict TypeScript**: No any types, comprehensive type coverage
- **Runtime Validation**: Type guards for Roblox object validation
- **Consistent Naming**: kebab-case files, PascalCase types
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: TSDoc headers throughout

## Current Development Priorities

Based on the analysis, here are the recommended next steps:

### High Priority (Core Gameplay)
1. **Implement Ability Cooldowns**: Add timing restrictions to ability usage
2. **Create Target Selection**: Mouse-based and area targeting systems
3. **Add Combat Mechanics**: Health, damage, and healing systems
4. **Connect Visual Effects**: Link abilities to particle/visual systems

### Medium Priority (Polish & Features)
1. **Complete UI Components**: Health bars, ability hotbars with cooldown displays
2. **Player Progression**: Basic leveling and stat systems
3. **Enhanced Networking**: Server validation and anti-cheat measures
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient ability and effect management

### Low Priority (Enhancement)
1. **Advanced Combat**: Status effects, buffs/debuffs
2. **Equipment System**: Gear that modifies abilities
3. **Social Features**: Teams, guilds, leaderboards
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly UI adaptations
