# Combat Service Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

The Combat Service is now successfully implemented in Soul Steel Alpha! This document provides a comprehensive guide to the combat system that was just created.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### Core Combat Service (`src/server/services/combat-service.ts`)

- **Singleton Pattern**: Follows the same architectural pattern as other services
- **Network Integration**: Uses existing `CombatRemotes` for client-server communication
- **Resource Integration**: Connects with `ResourceService` for health/damage management
- **Message Integration**: Provides feedback through `MessageService`

### Key Features

1. **Basic Attack System**
   - Player vs Player combat
   - Player vs NPC support (ready for NPC integration)
   - Damage calculation with variance
   - Critical hit system

2. **Weapon System**
   - Three default weapons: Fists, Basic Sword, Soul Blade
   - Weapon equipping/unequipping
   - Weapon-specific damage and critical rates
   - Network synchronization of weapon changes

3. **Combat Sessions**
   - Session tracking for organized combat
   - Participant management
   - Session start/end events

4. **Safety & Validation**
   - Character validation using `isSSEntity`
   - Self-attack prevention
   - Weapon ownership validation (extensible)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Service Architecture

```typescript
class CombatService {
    private static instance: CombatService;
    private activeSessions: Map<string, CombatSession>;
    private equippedWeapons: Map<SSEntity, string>;
    
    // Singleton pattern
    public static GetInstance(): CombatService;
    public Initialize(): void;
}
```

### Network Handlers

The service sets up handlers for:
- `ExecuteBasicAttack` - Player attacks another entity
- `RequestWeaponEquip` - Player equips a weapon
- `GetCombatStats` - Query combat statistics
- `GetEquippedWeapon` - Get currently equipped weapon

### Weapon Data Structure

```typescript
interface WeaponData {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    baseDamage: number;
    criticalChance: number;
    criticalMultiplier: number;
}
```

### Default Weapons

| Weapon | Base Damage | Crit Chance | Crit Multiplier |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fists | 10 | 5% | 1.5x |
| Basic Sword | 25 | 10% | 2.0x |
| Soul Blade | 40 | 15% | 2.5x |

## üéÆ Testing & Usage

### Test Client (`src/client/combat-test.client.ts`)

A test client was created with these controls:
- **T** - Attack nearest player
- **1** - Equip Fists
- **2** - Equip Basic Sword  
- **3** - Equip Soul Blade

### Service Integration

The combat service is automatically initialized in `src/server/main.server.ts`:

```typescript
import { CombatServiceInstance } from "./services/combat-service";
CombatServiceInstance.Initialize();
```

## üîó Integration Points

### With ResourceService

```typescript
// Applies damage through existing resource system
ResourceServiceInstance.ModifyResource(target, "health", -damage);
```

### With MessageService

```typescript
// Provides user feedback for combat actions
MessageServiceInstance.SendMessageToPlayer(player, message);
```

### With Network Layer

Uses the existing `CombatRemotes` defined in `src/shared/network/combat-remotes.ts`:
- All combat events are properly typed
- Client-server communication is secure
- Broadcast events keep all players synchronized

## üöÄ Next Steps & Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities

1. **NPC Integration**: Connect with `UnifiedNPCService` for NPC combat
2. **Ability Integration**: Link with `AbilityService` for ability-based attacks
3. **UI Integration**: Create combat UI with health bars and damage indicators
4. **Asset Integration**: Replace placeholder weapon IDs with actual Roblox assets

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Combat Mechanics**
   - Blocking and dodging
   - Status effects and buffs
   - Combo systems
   - Different attack types

2. **Equipment System**
   - Armor and defense calculation
   - Equipment durability
   - Equipment modifiers

3. **Combat Analytics**
   - Damage tracking
   - Combat statistics
   - Leaderboards

## üéâ Success Summary

The combat service successfully:

‚úÖ **Integrates with existing architecture** - Follows Soul Steel Alpha patterns  
‚úÖ **Provides core combat functionality** - Basic attacks and weapon system  
‚úÖ **Maintains type safety** - Full TypeScript compliance  
‚úÖ **Supports extensibility** - Ready for NPC and ability integration  
‚úÖ **Includes testing tools** - Client test script for immediate validation  

The combat system is now ready for gameplay testing and further development!

## üîß Quick Start

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Start Roblox Studio and load the place
3. Use the test client controls (T, 1, 2, 3) to test combat
4. Check server console for combat service initialization
5. Extend the system by connecting with abilities and NPCs

The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of Soul Steel Alpha development!
