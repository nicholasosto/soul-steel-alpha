## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Modular server services
2. **Atomic Design**: UI component organization
3. **Reactive Programming**: Fusion-based state management
4. **Type-Safe Keys**: String literal types for identifiers
5. **Metadata-Driven**: Configuration-based ability definitions

### Key Technologies

- **roblox-ts ^3.0.0**: TypeScript to Lua compilation
- **@rbxts/net**: Type-safe networking
- **@rbxts/fusion**: Reactive UI framework
- **@rbxts/types ^1.0.800**: Roblox API types

### Build & Development Scripts

- **`npm run build`**: Compile TypeScript to Lua (rbxtsc)
- **`npm run watch`**: Development mode with auto-compilation
