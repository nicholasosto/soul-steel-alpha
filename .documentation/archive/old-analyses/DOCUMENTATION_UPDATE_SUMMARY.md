## Combat System Documentation Highlights

### Service Architecture
- Singleton pattern with `CombatServiceInstance`
- Integration with ResourceService, AbilityService, and AnimationService
- Event-driven reactive combat mechanics

### Weapon System
- 7 weapon types: Sword, Staff, Bow, Dagger, Hammer, Shield, Fists
- Stat requirements and special effects
- Equipment validation and management

### Combat Mechanics
- Hit chance calculations (accuracy vs evasion)
- Damage system with critical hits and modifiers
- Range validation and combat action processing

### Combo System
- Skill chain sequences with time windows
- Bonus damage multipliers for successful combos
- Pattern matching for predefined combinations

### Combat Sessions
- Multiple session types: PvP, PvE, Duel, Raid, Training
- Participant tracking and session lifecycle management
- Optional turn-based combat support

## API Documentation

### Public Methods
- Registration: `RegisterCombatant`, `unregisterCombatant`
- Equipment: `EquipWeapon`, `GetEquippedWeapon`
- Actions: `ExecuteBasicAttack`, `ExecuteWeaponSkill`
- Combos: `StartComboChain`, `ContinueComboChain`

### Type Definitions
- Combat-specific interfaces and types
- Session management structures
- Combo chain definitions

## Integration Documentation

### Service Coordination
- ResourceService for damage/healing processing
- AbilityService for combo validation and cooldowns
- AnimationService for combat animation triggers

### Network Layer
- Client-server combat action communication
- Event broadcasting for combat feedback
- Secure validation and authorization

## Usage Examples

### Basic Combat Setup
```typescript
CombatServiceInstance.RegisterCombatant(character, weapon);
CombatServiceInstance.ExecuteBasicAttack(attacker, target);
```

### Combo System
```typescript
CombatServiceInstance.StartComboChain(character, "Melee");
const multiplier = CombatServiceInstance.ContinueComboChain(character, "Soul-Drain");
```

### Weapon Management
```typescript
const success = CombatServiceInstance.EquipWeapon(character, legendaryWeapon);
const currentWeapon = CombatServiceInstance.GetEquippedWeapon(character);
```

## Future Documentation Needs

### Planned Documentation
- Weapon Catalog Reference guide
- Combat Network Protocol documentation
- Resource Service comprehensive guide
- Combat balancing and analytics guide

### Extension Documentation
- Custom weapon type creation
- Advanced combo pattern development
- Status effect system expansion
- AI combat behavior patterns

---

All documentation has been updated to reflect the new Combat Service integration and maintains consistency with the existing project documentation standards.
