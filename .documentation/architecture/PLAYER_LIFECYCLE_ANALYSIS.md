## üìä **Refactoring Priority Analysis**

### **High Priority Refactoring (70%+ Score)**

1. **NPC Demo Service Events** (90% Score)
   - **Issue**: Demo code in production codebase
   - **Recommendation**: Remove or move to development-only builds
   - **Impact**: Code cleanliness, production performance

### **Medium Priority Refactoring (30-70% Score)**

1. **Humanoid Health Tracking** (30% Score)
   - **Issue**: Potential overlap with ResourceService health tracking
   - **Recommendation**: Consolidate health tracking into single service
   - **Impact**: Reduced complexity, improved performance

2. **Network Registration** (25% Score)
   - **Issue**: Duplicated registration logic across services
   - **Recommendation**: Create centralized player registration system
   - **Impact**: Reduced code duplication, easier maintenance

3. **Humanoid Disconnection** (20% Score)
   - **Issue**: Could be consolidated with other cleanup operations
   - **Recommendation**: Create unified cleanup manager
   - **Impact**: Simplified cleanup logic

### **Low Priority Refactoring (10-30% Score)**

1. **Resource Initialization** (15% Score)
   - **Issue**: Could be consolidated with profile loading
   - **Recommendation**: Merge initialization steps
   - **Impact**: Slightly improved startup performance

2. **Client State Setup** (10% Score)
   - **Issue**: Minor optimization opportunities
   - **Recommendation**: Batch network calls during initialization
   - **Impact**: Minor performance improvement

3. **Resource Reset** (10% Score)
   - **Issue**: Could be more explicit about respawn mechanics
   - **Recommendation**: Add explicit respawn resource restoration
   - **Impact**: Clearer respawn behavior

## üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Recommendations**

### **1. Service Consolidation**

Create a **PlayerLifecycleManager** service to coordinate:

- Player joining/leaving events
- Character spawning/respawning
- Cross-service cleanup operations
- Centralized player state tracking

### **2. Health System Unification**

Consolidate health tracking between:

- `HumanoidServices` (native Roblox health)
- `ResourceService` (game resource system)
- Choose single source of truth for health

### **3. Demo Code Separation**

Move development/demo code to separate modules:

- Environment-based loading
- Clear separation from production systems
- Easier maintenance and deployment

### **4. Event-Driven Architecture**

Implement centralized event system:

- Single event bus for player lifecycle events
- Loose coupling between services
- Easier testing and debugging

## üéØ **Implementation Priority**

1. **Phase 1**: Remove demo service dependencies (High impact, low effort)
2. **Phase 2**: Consolidate health tracking systems (Medium impact, medium effort)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement PlayerLifecycleManager (High impact, high effort)
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize network registration (Medium impact, low effort)

## üìà **Success Metrics**

- **Code Reduction**: Target 10-15% reduction in lifecycle-related code
- **Performance**: Reduce player join time by 5-10%
- **Maintainability**: Centralize 80% of lifecycle logic in dedicated services
- **Testing**: Enable unit testing of lifecycle events
