# Client Controller Architecture Guidelines

## üèóÔ∏è **Controller Responsibilities Matrix**

| Controller | **Primary Purpose** | **What It Should Handle** | **What It Should NOT Handle** |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **InputController** | Raw input mapping | ‚Ä¢ Keyboard/mouse events<br>‚Ä¢ Input validation<br>‚Ä¢ Action emission | ‚Ä¢ Game logic<br>‚Ä¢ Business rules<br>‚Ä¢ UI updates |
| **MovementController** | Player movement mechanics | ‚Ä¢ Running state<br>‚Ä¢ Jump mechanics<br>‚Ä¢ Walk speed changes | ‚Ä¢ Abilities<br>‚Ä¢ Network calls<br>‚Ä¢ UI state |
| **AbilityController** | Ability system management | ‚Ä¢ Ability activation<br>‚Ä¢ Cooldown management<br>‚Ä¢ Effect triggering<br>‚Ä¢ UI integration | ‚Ä¢ Movement<br>‚Ä¢ Input handling<br>‚Ä¢ Zone logic |
| **ZoneController** | Zone management | ‚Ä¢ Zone creation<br>‚Ä¢ Zone events<br>‚Ä¢ Player zone tracking | ‚Ä¢ Abilities<br>‚Ä¢ Movement<br>‚Ä¢ Input processing |
| **ClientController** | Central coordination | ‚Ä¢ Controller initialization<br>‚Ä¢ Action routing<br>‚Ä¢ System integration | ‚Ä¢ Direct game logic<br>‚Ä¢ UI rendering<br>‚Ä¢ Data processing |

## üö´ **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

### ‚ùå **Don't Create These:**
- `GameActionController` - Too vague, overlaps with AbilityController
- `PlayerController` - Too broad, would overlap with multiple controllers
- `UIController` - UI should be reactive, not controlled
- `NetworkController` - Network calls should be in domain-specific controllers

### ‚ùå **Don't Add These Responsibilities:**
- **InputController**: Don't add cooldown checking, ability validation, or game state
- **MovementController**: Don't add ability casting, zone interactions, or network calls
- **AbilityController**: Don't add movement logic, input handling, or zone management
- **ZoneController**: Don't add ability logic, movement handling, or input processing

## ‚úÖ **Decision Framework**

Before adding new functionality, ask:

1. **Does this belong in an existing controller?**
   - If yes ‚Üí Add to existing controller
   - If no ‚Üí Continue to #2

2. **Is this a new domain with 3+ distinct responsibilities?**
   - If yes ‚Üí Create new controller
   - If no ‚Üí Extend existing controller

3. **Would this create overlap with existing controllers?**
   - If yes ‚Üí Refactor to eliminate overlap
   - If no ‚Üí Proceed with implementation

## üéØ **Single Responsibility Examples**

### ‚úÖ **Good Additions:**
```typescript
// AbilityController - ability-related
public getAbilityCooldownPercent(key: AbilityKey): number
public cancelAllCooldowns(): void
public getActiveAbilities(): AbilityKey[]

// MovementController - movement-related  
public setCustomWalkSpeed(speed: number): void
public enableFlying(): void
public getMovementState(): MovementState

// ZoneController - zone-related
public getPlayerZones(): ZoneKey[]
public createTempZone(region: Region3): void
public destroyZone(key: ZoneKey): void
```

### ‚ùå **Bad Additions:**
```typescript
// DON'T: AbilityController handling movement
public teleportPlayer(position: Vector3): void  // ‚Üí MovementController

// DON'T: MovementController handling abilities  
public castAbilityWhileMoving(key: AbilityKey): void  // ‚Üí AbilityController

// DON'T: InputController handling game logic
public activateAbilityIfNotOnCooldown(key: AbilityKey): void  // ‚Üí AbilityController
```

## üìã **Code Review Checklist**

When reviewing PRs, check:

- [ ] Does new functionality fit the controller's single responsibility?
- [ ] Are we creating duplicate logic across controllers?
- [ ] Is the controller getting too large (>300 lines = consider splitting)?
- [ ] Are we mixing concerns (input + game logic, network + UI, etc.)?
- [ ] Does this follow the established patterns?

## üîÑ **Refactoring Triggers**

Refactor when you notice:

1. **Duplicate code** across controllers
2. **Controllers calling each other** excessively (beyond ClientController routing)
3. **Controllers growing beyond 300 lines**
4. **Unclear naming** or responsibilities
5. **New developers struggling** to understand where code belongs

## üé™ **Extension Points**

For future growth, consider these bounded contexts:

- **CombatController** - When combat becomes complex enough (damage calculation, targeting)
- **InventoryController** - When item management is needed
- **ChatController** - When chat/communication features are added
- **SettingsController** - When user preferences/keybinds become complex

Each should have **3+ distinct responsibilities** before creation.
